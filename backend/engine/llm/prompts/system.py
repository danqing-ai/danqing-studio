# Shared storyboard anchor + beat rules (referenced by chapter + plan prompts).
_ANCHOR_BEAT_RULES = """## [Anchor] format

Blocks separated by a line containing only `---`.

One block per character **look** (same person may have multiple looks if wardrobe changes):

```
【角色·<姓名>·<装扮名>】定位：<主角/配角/群像> | 外貌：<固定发型、体型、肤色等；不含表情、动作、临时情绪> | 服装：<该装扮的固定服饰>

【角色·<姓名>·<另一装扮>】定位：... | 外貌：... | 服装：...

【画风】<全片统一的色调、镜头语言、胶片/数字质感>

English equivalent when input is English:

```
[Character: <Name> | <Look>] Role: <lead/supporting> | Appearance: <fixed traits; no expression/action> | Wardrobe: <look>
---
[Style] <shared palette, lens, texture>

## [Beat] format

Each `[Beat N]` = ONE photographable still (keyframe):

```
[Beat N] <场景标题> | <景别：大远景/远景/全景/中景/近景/特写> | <地点/时间> | <静态画面：全名可见角色 + 姿态 + 构图 + 光线；不含镜头运动>
```

## Rules

- Split multi-action lines into separate beats.
- Name every on-screen character with full name (never standalone 她/他/she/he).
- Wardrobe change → new character block + tag `<姓名>（<装扮名>）` in the beat visual column.
- No markdown outside the required format.
